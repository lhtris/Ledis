Things are completed:
    - 2 String function
    - SADD, SREM, SMEMBERS funtions of Set funtions
    - UI of CLI

Things are still in process:
    - Expiration features.
    - UI is still disable for functions development
    - Set functions may not work properly since I did not have time to check (I'm sorry)

Overall experiments
    The assessment is a great time to check my coding skill and to know where I need to improve.
    I'm sorry for the incompleted assessment because I still not get used to work with JS and React so it take more time for me to implement the code. But it is great to learn new things. 
    The assessment helps me in gaining a background knowledge of Command Palette (
        - set Keys and Functions for each,
        - build CLI UI
    ).
